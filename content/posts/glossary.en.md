* __API REST__ 

Simply put, a REST API is an application hosted on a remote server that is queried by the browser using http or https. If you are curious, here is an article in French on the [Practical Programming] website (https://practicalprogramming.fr/api-rest/).


* __Back__

In addition to the Front end, the _Back end__ is the part of the application that runs on a server remotely from the user. The user interacts with the Back end via the interface on his browser. For example the user validates a form, data can be transmitted to a server, which will return a response to the browser. The [PHP](https://www.php.net/) language is a language that runs on a remote server.


* __Front__

In web development, the _Front end_ is the part of the application that runs on the user's browser. The [html](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/HTML) and [css](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/CSS_basics) languages are executed on browsers. 


* __NodeJS__

NodeJS allows to create Javascript applications running on servers. See the [official website](https://nodejs.dev/).

* __React__

React is a Javascript library to generate code executed on the browser. See the [official website](https://fr.reactjs.org/).

* __Redux__
