Fifteen years of experience in Systems and Networks infrastructure project management.

I have managed many projects of all sizes, the largest being multi-site international projects impacting several thousand people and budgets of several million euros.

I'm used to manage systems and network operations (Microsoft, Cisco, HP, Dell...).

My management experience (10 people max) for more than 10 years allows me to manage a team with serenity.

I recently added the skill of Web Developer. Being a computer and telecom Engineer, I have always developed for my professional needs, such as the supervision of network equipments. I am now up to date thanks to 6 months of intensive development in Javascript Front and Back (React-Redux, Node JS, PostgreSQL and MongoDB), which continues every day.
