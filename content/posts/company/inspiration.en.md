# Inspiration like breathing
My inspiration comes from many domains. It's so natural for me to change my perspective on a subject, like a breath.

Let's take the example of a web application to be developed for a specific. What are the codes of this job? Is it a rather visual job? High-tech? What are their values?

I'm like a cartoonist who needs to understand the anatomy of an animal to better represent it.

I have a transversal vision of computer science. I see the links between the virtual world of applications and the real elements: the way information circulates on the Internet, the flows within the company, the security elements, the weaknesses of an IT architecture, the location of the data to be processed, etc.

This transversal vision includes users of course. Their experience as a user of an application or of IT in general depends on their life history, their vision of the world, their values, their possible handicap. I am aware of this diversity and the need to adapt myself to each project.
