# Web application development
Technically, I'm up to date with the latest Javascript, React/Redux and NodeJS developments with PostgreSQL/MongoDB databases.

I have indeed followed a 6 months training in 2020. But I've been coding applications and websites for more than 10 years, some for my own professional needs in IT, others for customers as freelance.

When I was IT manager, I worked on the supervision of the company's network, a multi-site network of 6000 people in France. This application was developed in PHP, without any framework, with alarm reporting, equipment configuration management, mapping with remote control of equipment, etc...

I developed some applications with the LARAVEL (PHP) framework, in particular the management of an infirmary: management of patients, appointments, specific information, edition of thematic or per-patient reports.

Finally I created some real websites (humanitarian association, liberal profession) while developing design and customer relationship skills in the web domain.

### Why Javascript now: because it is everywhere !!
* Make en existing website dynamic with a simple Javascript code page :
* Creating Web interfaces by managing components, it's life changing! I use React for the Frontend.
* Components become too numerous with React? Redux allows to manage even better.
* Need to manage persistent data, user sessions? NodeJS is there.

I'm comfortable on the Front (browser) side because I'm very creative. That's why my desire to develop applications is becoming more and more important in my activities!

Back side because I learned to manage SQL databases a long time ago, at Engineering School. I've always kept in touch with the world of Data in my job, for example, gathering data from infrastructure equipment, making them 'talk' to build dashboards with relevant KPIs (indicators).

# Consulting and Project Management Infrastructure
I have managed numerous infrastructure projects in companies of all sizes.

The project management was either internalized in my team or entrusted to integrators depending on the complexity of the project.

I've been involved in some great LAN and WAN network projects, in France and abroad.

In terms of operational skills, I have always managed systems directly:

* Cisco and HP network among others: switches, routers, firewalls, etc.
* Microsoft network systems: Active Directory, Windows 7 and 10 PCs, Exchange, Office 365

I manage all types of projects, most often in consulting and project management.
